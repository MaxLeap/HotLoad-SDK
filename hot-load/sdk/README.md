# CodePush Management SDK (Node.js)

A JavaScript library for programmatically managing your CodePush account (e.g. creating apps, promoting releases), which allows authoring Node.js-based build and/or deployment scripts, without needing to shell out to the [CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md).


## Getting Started

1. Create an access key to authenticate with the CodePush server using the following CodePush CLI command:

    ```shell
    code-push access-key add "DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_KEY"
    ```
    
    If you already created a key that you want to use here, then you can retrieve it by running `code-push access-key ls` and using the value of the `Key` column for the key you wish to use.
    
2. Install the management SDK by running `npm install code-push --save`

3. Import it using the following statement (using ES6 syntax as applicable):

    ```javascript
    var CodePush = require("code-push");    
    ```
    
4. Create an instance of the `CodePush` class, passing it the access key you created or retrieved in step #1:

    ```javascript
    var codePush = new CodePush("YOUR_ACCESS_KEY");
    ```

5. Begin automating the management of your account! For more details on what you can do with this `codePush` object, refer to the API reference section below.

## API Reference

The `code-push` module exports a single class (typically referred to as `CodePush`), which represents a proxy to the CodePush account management REST API. This class has a single constructor for authenticating with the CodePush service, and a collection of instance methods that correspond to the commands in the management [CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/README.md), which allow you to programmatically control every aspect of your CodePush account.
